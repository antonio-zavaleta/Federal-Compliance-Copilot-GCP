# Federal Compliance Copilot (GCP) ü§ñüìú

An AI-powered agentic system designed to analyze US Federal Request for Proposal (RFP) documents, extract key requirements, and identify compliance risks using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and state-of-the-art GenAI models.

---


## üéØ The Problem

Federal RFPs are lengthy and complex. Manual review is slow, error-prone, and risky. Missing a requirement can mean a non-compliant proposal and lost opportunities.

This project builds an "Analyst Copilot" to automate RFP review, saving time and reducing risk.

---


## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive Q&A:** Ask questions about RFPs in plain English.
* **Automated Requirements Extraction:** Identifies and lists mandatory requirements ("shall", "must", etc.).
* **Risk Identification:** Flags ambiguous or contradictory language for legal review.
* **Executive Summary:** Generates concise summaries with key dates, deliverables, and sections.
* **Knowledge Base:** Creates a searchable KB from uploaded PDFs using a RAG pipeline.

---


## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

* **Cloud & AI Services:**
    * **Google Cloud Storage:** Stores uploaded RFP PDFs.
    * **Vertex AI / Document AI:** Foundation models and document parsing (planned).
* **Core Framework:**
    * **LangChain / LangGraph:** RAG pipeline and agent orchestration.
* **Application & Deployment:**
    * **FastAPI:** REST API for agent functionality.
    * **Poetry:** Python dependency and packaging management.
    * **Docker:** Containerized deployment for portability.
